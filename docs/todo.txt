# considering -n, -q, -r options only
# pause after every functions and commits
# follow TDD
# start working by creating file tail.js , test directory and src directory
# make package.json
# use thesuarus to name variables and functions

v 0.1 only one option '-n' with a single file and std input 
  node tail.js  docs/num.txt -> gives last 10 lines
  node tail.js -n2 docs/num.txt -> gives last 2 lines
  node tail.js <docs/num.txt-> gives last 10 lines of std input
  node tail.js -n2 <docs/num.txt-> gives last 2 lines of std input
  node tail.js -q docs/num.txt-> gives error text becuase no file existing 
    such as -q
  node tail.js -n2 -n3 docs/num.txt-> gives last 2 lines

v 0.2 this version should accept the options -q and -n also
  and mutiple files

  node tail.js num.txt small.txt -> gives last 10 lines of both files with file names
  node tail.js -n2 num.txt small.txt -> gives last 2 lines of both files with file names
  node tail.js -n2 -q num.txt small.txt -> gives last 10 lines of both files without file names
